### Expected features

The purpose of this repository is to ship a clean but complete boilerplate to develop and design new ui kit, pass by on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/01jam) to follow the live development of the following features:

| Feature                              | Implemented |
| :----------------------------------- | :---------- |
| Full Typescript                      | ✅          |
| Storybook                            | ❎          |
| Separated CSS files (a.e. variables) | ❎          |
| All basic HTML templates             | ❎          |

## Getting Started

You have two options:

1.  Automatic install - suggested;
2.  Manual install.

### Automatic install - suggested -

-   Run `npx @01jam/forge-ui <ui-package-name>`;
-   Done.

This command will create a `ui-package-name` folder with a ready-to-code scaffolding.

### Manual install

-   Clone this repository whenever you like `git clone https://github.com/01jam/ui.git`;
-   Do the following actions:
    -   Run `rm -fr .git` to remove the `.git` folder and avoid unwanted push to this repository;
    -   Open the `package.json` and update `name, version, description..` fields of your repository;
    -   Done.

By following these steps you will have the exact same output of the suggested automatic install.

### Usage

Open the folder using your favourite code editor and add your components inside the `src/components` folder, we have already created some basic standard components you can use as blueprint to generate your own.

You may notice that some `*.scss` files are using some variables, you can edit them from the `styles/variables.scss` files. This file will be compiled separately ready to be imported in your final app.

We decided to use `css` native variables because allow great flexibility and can be overwritten without any effort in order to customise your ui kit.

Once ready just launch `npm run build` command to build your ui kit package.

It ships (find below a short introduction about different kind of modules):

-   UMD global package - generated by Webpack;
-   Common JS - generated by Typescript compiler (`tsc`);
-   ES Module - generated by Typescript compiler (`tsc`).

### Local testing

Before publishing you package to npm you can test it in your local development in the same way you would do for an online package.

How to setup a sample playground and test your ui kit (we will use `create-react-app` but you can use whatever React framework you like):

-   Move to a different location from the one you created your ui kit in - a.e. `cd ..`;
-   Create a new `create-react-app` whit typescript template using the following command: `npx create-react-app sample-ui-playground --template typescript`;
-   Move inside your playground project root a.e. `cd sample-ui-playground`;
-   Now install your local ui kit as you would for any other package a.e. `npm i ../ui-package-name`;
-   Import your components as you would do for any other ui kit a.e. `import {Button} from 'ui-package-name'`.

Depending on your code editor you may refresh your window each time you build a new version of your ui kit.
In this way you avoid the use of `npm link` and `npm unlink` each time you compile a new version of your ui kit and it will behave exactly like any other npm package.

### Publishing

First of all you must `npm login` to your account. By default the version of your ui kit will be `0.0.1-beta.0` to publish it as beta (suggested until you reach a working project) you can just execute `npm publish --tag beta` and et voilà, your package is ready to be installed with `npm i ui-package-name@0.0.1-beta.x`.
Once you are ready to publish a final version just remove the `-beta.x` and run `npm publish`, now it will be available with the `latest` tag and it can be installed with `npm i ui-package-name`.

Happy coding :))

# Bonus tutorials and insights

If you reached this point you read the entire doc and you wanted more insight about the different module types...I can feel it.
Down here you can find more information and clarification about the outputs of this library. I'm writing it here because I know it can be a little bit overlwhelming at first but it is important in order to understand how this build output works and it is related to this library doc...still.

## Module types

I had some problems figuring out all this JS modules/UMD messy system, for that reason I copied a brief explanation here. If you already know what you are dealing with just jump to the "Usage section".

## About modules

-   ✨ https://dev.to/iggredible/what-the-heck-are-cjs-amd-umd-and-esm-ikm
-   ✨ https://flaviocopes.com/es-modules/
-   ✨ http://jargon.js.org/_glossary/UMD.md

As projects scale up, we need to modularize code into independent modules with separate namespaces. In addition to better organization, modularization brings the capabilities of encapsulation, dependency management, and reusability.

### CommonJS - CJS

CJS is short for CommonJS, suitable for Node and other bundlers

```Javascript
/* example import */

const goal = require('./goal.js');

/* example export */

module.exports = function goal(n) {
  // Function implementation
}
```

### Universal Module Definition - UMD

Is a pattern of universal module definition for JavaScript modules. These modules are capable of working everywhere, be it in the client, on the server or elsewhere.

```Javascript
/* example mess, just trust it */

(function (root, factory) {
    if (typeof define === "function" && define.amd) {
        define(["jquery", "underscore"], factory);
    } else if (typeof exports === "object") {
        module.exports = factory(require("jquery"), require("underscore"));
    } else {
        root.Requester = factory(root.$, root._);
    }
}(this, function ($, _) {
    // this is where I defined my module implementation

    var Requester = {
		// Function implementation
	};

    return Requester;
}));
```

### ES Modules - ESM

While Node.js has been using the CommonJS standard for years, the browser never had a module system, as every major decision such as a module system must be first standardized by ECMAScript and then implemented by the browser.

```Javascript
/* example import */

import {foo, bar} from './myLib';

/* example export */

export default function() {
	// Function implementation
};

export const function1() {
	// Function implementation
};

export const function2() {
	// Function implementation
};
```
