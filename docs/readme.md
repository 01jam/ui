# @01jam/forge-ui

This prepository is a boilerplate generator to easily create new react ui-kit package ready to be uploaded on npm.
It ships:

-   UMD global package - generated by Webpack;
-   Common JS - generated by Typescript compiler (`tsc`);
-   ES Module - generated by Typescript compiler (`tsc`).

I had some problems figuring out all this JS modules/UMD messy system, for that reason I copied a brief explanation here. If you already know what you are dealing with just jump to the "Usage section".

## About modules

As projects scale up, we need to modularize code into independent modules with separate namespaces. In addition to better organization, modularization brings the capabilities of encapsulation, dependency management, and reusability.

### CommonJS - CJS

CJS is short for CommonJS, suitable for Node and other bundlers

```Javascript
/* example import */

const goal = require('./goal.js');

/* example export */

module.exports = function goal(n) {
  // Function implementation
}
```

### Universal Module Definition - UMD

Is a pattern of universal module definition for JavaScript modules. These modules are capable of working everywhere, be it in the client, on the server or elsewhere.

```Javascript
/* example mess, just trust it */

(function (root, factory) {
    if (typeof define === "function" && define.amd) {
        define(["jquery", "underscore"], factory);
    } else if (typeof exports === "object") {
        module.exports = factory(require("jquery"), require("underscore"));
    } else {
        root.Requester = factory(root.$, root._);
    }
}(this, function ($, _) {
    // this is where I defined my module implementation

    var Requester = {
		// Function implementation
	};

    return Requester;
}));
```

### ES Modules - ESM

While Node.js has been using the CommonJS standard for years, the browser never had a module system, as every major decision such as a module system must be first standardized by ECMAScript and then implemented by the browser.

```Javascript
/* example import */

import {foo, bar} from './myLib';

/* example export */

export default function() {
	// Function implementation
};

export const function1() {
	// Function implementation
};

export const function2() {
	// Function implementation
};
```

## About this boilerplate

`/bin` scripts to execute `npx @01jam/forge-ui kit-name`
`/src` all components are here
`.gitignore` files that shouldn't be uploaded to your repository
`.npmignore` files that shouldn't be published to your npm package
`package.json` package information
`tsconfig.json` typescript configuration
`webpack.conf.js` webpack configuration

## How to use this boilerplate

1. Write cool components
2. Run `npm run build` to create the `/lib` folder with the 3 modules inside.
3. Create a playground `nxp create-react-app kit-tester --typescript`
4. Install compiled package `npm i ../path/to/ui-kit-name`
5. Publish it on npm with `npm publish`

## What next?

As next step would be nice to insert storybook.
